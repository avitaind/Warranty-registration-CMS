                <p style="text-align: justify;">Greetings from the NOVITA family. Although NOVITA makes every effort to
                    ensure that every product is
                    free from manufacturing flaws, there is really no way for us to guarantee that the product is in
                    perfect
                    working order without actually opening it. You can ask for a replacement if a manufacturing flaw is
                    discovered in a product you recently purchased from NOVITA.</p>
                <h2>Instances that are covered under Warranty</h2>
